# Why I read like this
I grappled with optimizing my engagement with each piece of literature, often facing challenges such as forgetting crucial information or misplacing papers. In response, I dedicated significant time to contemplating what I sought from each piece of literature and devised strategies to connect dots into cohesive lines or even intricate networks. Consequently, I distilled my reading experience into four pivotal actions: concluding, sorting, comparing, and finding inspiration.

## Concluding
One key part of reading literature is the conclusion: what is the problem they focus on, how did this paper solve the problem, and what are their methods' advantages and possible extensions? These are all essential elements for the literature review.  \
However, after reading a great amount of paper, we may face problems such as forgetting the key information of each one and having difficulty finding the paper we want. To fix these two problems, I chose to record all the papers I read in the Notion, a platform that easily builds connections between information. Through the **Paper** column, I could easily find the details when I want to use some method; through the 4-level classification: area, focus, sub-type, and paper-type, I would filter all papers under one topic conveniently.
