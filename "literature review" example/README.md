# Why I read like this
I grappled with optimizing my engagement with each piece of literature, often facing challenges such as forgetting crucial information or misplacing papers. In response, I dedicated significant time to contemplating what I sought from each piece of literature and devised strategies to connect dots into cohesive lines or even intricate networks. Consequently, I distilled my reading experience into four pivotal actions: concluding, sorting, comparing, and finding inspiration.

## Concluding
One key part of reading literature is the conclusion: what is the problem they focus on, how did this paper solve the problem, and what are their methods' advantages and possible extensions? These are all essential elements for the literature review.  \
However, after reading a great amount of paper, we may face problems such as forgetting the key information of each one and having difficulty finding the paper we want. To fix these two problems, I chose to record all the papers I read in the Notion, a platform that easily builds connections between information. Through the **Paper** column, I could easily find the details when I want to use some method; through the 4-level classification: area, focus, sub-type, and paper-type, I would filter all papers under one topic conveniently.  

## Sorting & Comparing
Apart from extracting key information from each paper, one important reason behind reading literature is to find the development of this topic. Therefore, to get a chronological order of each topic, I added the **Date** column. \
Besides, to compare the papers within one topic and across different topics, using texts to record key elements is troublesome with comparison. To resolve this problem, I added some labels to simplify the problem, methods, advantages, and extension points, which are easy to compare after filtering.

## Inspiring
The most important part for researchers is to explore new areas and solve puzzles, which is also the goal of reading papers. \
To help me decide how much do I need this paper, I add columns **2.1 to 2.3** to learn more about the background of the problem, evalute the causes of the problem, and whether the problem deserves further exploration. \
The columns **4 and 6** is introduced to compare the new method in the paper with other baseline methods, and make my own analysis about the superiority of method in that field. \
Finally, I introduce columns **7 and 7.1** to record my intuitive ideas about further extensions of methods in that paper. The **7.1** could include links to theoritical or empirical support to the improvement.
