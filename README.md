# Introduction for graduate application material repository
I am glad that you visit my GitHub page, this README file will give you a brief guide about what are included in each of the folders. It could be easier to track if you have read my application essays (Statement of Purpose/Academic Statement of Purpose/Statement of Academic Purpose/Academic Statement/Personal Statement/Candidate Statement) first.
 <br />
In each folder, there is also one *README* file that gives an overview of each experience and one *concepts & details* file that introduces key concepts required to understand the topic.

If you would like to schedule a meeting with me, feel free to check the [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZjEhVQxF_RBALJ7ht5AAa6ntHYPDYNBxh6bhurICrs/edit#gid=225956874) of my free time. I will update the sheet weekly. *Use Ctrl + Click to open the link on a new page*

## Fairness-aware contrastive learning on GNN
This folder contains presentation slide of my summer research experience at UIUC, which corresponding to the second paragraph about my preparation in my application essay. <br />
Given the five minutes time limit for the presentation, the **presentation slide** gives a brief background introduction of fairness in GNN and contrastive learning, introduces the fair sampling method and show sample experimental results.
