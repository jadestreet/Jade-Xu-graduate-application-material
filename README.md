# Introduction for graduate application material repository
I am glad that you visit my GitHub page, this readme file will give you a brief guide about what are included in each of the folders. It could be easier to track if you have read my application essays (Statement of Purpose/Academic Statement of Purpose/Statement of Academic Purpose/Academic Statement/Personal Statement/Candidate Statement) first.
 <br />
In each folder, there is also one README file that gives an overview of each experience. The following sections introduces files in each folder.

The **report** is meant to showcase the outcomes of the project. <br />
The **code** is the algorithm I built for reproduing the process of burning graph.<br />
